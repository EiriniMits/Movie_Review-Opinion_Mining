# Movie_Review-Opinion_Mining

This project was created for academic purposes on the subject of 'Information Retrieval' at the Aristotle University of Thessaloniki.

In this project we apply Opinion Mining/Sentiment Analysis Techniques on movie reviews datasets, so as to identify whether a review is possitive or negative (1 or 0). Opinion mining provides a set of tools and techniques for extracting and classifying subjective information form the contents. 

This project implements two Supervised Opinion Mining Techniques: 
* Na√Øve Bayes  
* K-Nearest-Neighbors
